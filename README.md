## Seattle Broadband Speed Test

A Jupyter notebook that queries the Socrata API for the latest [data](https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/data.seattle.gov/v9zk-3thk) from the city of Seattle's [Broadband Speed Test tool](http://www.seattle.gov/broadband-speed-test) and provides visualisations to help understand the distribution of speeds.

Most figures have commented out code to save graphs as pdf graphics.

Skeleton directories exist for future development of module.
